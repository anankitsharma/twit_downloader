# App Development To-Do List

## Phase 1 – Stability & Core Fixes
- Fix existing errors and crashes.  
- Improve overall error handling (no repeating error messages).  
- Ensure video downloads are retained (persist in app storage).  
- If a video is already downloaded, show **“Already Downloaded”** instead of re-downloading.  
- Retain downloads on homepage until user explicitly clears them or closes the app (don’t vanish on tab switch).  
- Optimize tab bar (fix middle button issue).  

## Phase 2 – UI/UX Enhancements
- Improve overall UI look and feel.  
- Update **settings screen** with a more premium design.  
- Improve **media player design**.  
- Adjust downloading placeholder UI:  
- Add **splash screen**.  
  - Show smaller tiles in downloads screen.  
  - Keep larger tiles on homepage.  
  - Keep it in **tiles view** (no full view popup).  
- Improve **input field style**.  


## Phase 3 – New Features
- Add support for **GIFs and images** download.  
- **Implement multiple language support** (multi-lingual UI/UX).  
- Add **Share button** (top of screen, keep color white).  
- Add **Rate & Review popup**.  
- Add top bar option for **Share / Rate**.  

## Phase 4 – Monetization & Analytics
- Integrate **Firebase**.  
- Add **ads** (minimal to start with).  

## Phase 5 – Design Benchmarking
- Review premium design patterns from competitor apps.  
- Apply learnings to polish layouts, styles, and interactions.  

## Phase 6 – Platform Readiness
- Make app **production ready for Pinterest** downloads.  
- Ensure **Twitter app** version is stable while preparing Pinterest support.  




let's go deeper in the first task implementation only we will test it and I'll run it in android studio and tell you feedback ...

-the issue of downloads not showing in downloads tab is still there after we reopen the app, as most of the apps keep the downloads whatever user has downloaded through our app in downloads section...

- so dig deeper check different repos , read medium artichles check forums how it is implemented properly, what method is used etc etc, 

- keep rechkign the code until you're sure now it will show the downloads after we repoen app in the downlaoded or downlads tab as history


final resuslt all the downlaods which have been done by user should be there and show as other apps do
