let's go deeper in the first task implementation only we will test it and I'll run it in android studio and tell you feedback ...

-the issue of downloads not showing in downloads tab is still there after we reopen the app, as most of the apps keep the downloads whatever user has downloaded through our app in downloads section...

- so dig deeper check different repos , read medium artichles check forums how it is implemented properly, what method is used etc etc, 

- keep rechkign the code until you're sure now it will show the downloads after we repoen app in the downlaoded or downlads tab as history


final resuslt all the downlaods which have been done by user should be there and show as other apps do
