# App Development To-Do List

## Phase 1 – Stability & Core Fixes
- Fix existing errors and crashes.  
- Improve overall error handling (no repeating error messages).  
- Ensure video downloads are retained (persist in app storage).  
- If a video is already downloaded, show **“Already Downloaded”** instead of re-downloading.  
- Retain downloads on homepage until user explicitly clears them or closes the app (don’t vanish on tab switch).  
- Optimize tab bar (fix middle button issue).  

## Phase 2 – UI/UX Enhancements
- Improve overall UI look and feel.  
- Update **settings screen** with a more premium design.  
- Improve **media player design**.  
- Adjust downloading placeholder UI:  
  - Show smaller tiles in downloads screen.  
  - Keep larger tiles on homepage.  
  - Keep it in **tiles view** (no full view popup).  
- Improve **input field style**.  
- Add **splash screen**.  

## Phase 3 – New Features
- Add support for **GIFs and images** download.  
- **Implement multiple language support** (multi-lingual UI/UX).  
- Add **Share button** (top of screen, keep color white).  
- Add **Rate & Review popup**.  
- Add top bar option for **Share / Rate**.  

## Phase 4 – Monetization & Analytics
- Integrate **Firebase**.  
- Add **ads** (minimal to start with).  

## Phase 5 – Design Benchmarking
- Review premium design patterns from competitor apps.  
- Apply learnings to polish layouts, styles, and interactions.  

## Phase 6 – Platform Readiness
- Make app **production ready for Pinterest** downloads.  
- Ensure **Twitter app** version is stable while preparing Pinterest support.
