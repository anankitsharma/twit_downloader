Certainly! Here’s a step-by-step troubleshooting and fix plan for the Twit Downloader app not persisting downloaded videos in the downloads tab:

## Step-by-Step Debug Plan & Possible Fixes

### 1. **Verify Download Completion**
- Check that downloads actually finish and files are saved to disk.
- Confirm you see success messages/logs after each download.

### 2. **Check Database Persistence**
- Ensure each completed download triggers an insert into the downloads database.
- Add log statements or breakpoints to verify `DatabaseUtil.insertInfo()` runs and succeeds for every download.

### 3. **Validate Database Content**
- After downloads, query the database manually (or via debug logs) to confirm download info is stored.
- Use the test function in `DatabaseUtil` to check DB state.

### 4. **Confirm Flow/LiveData Updates**
- Make sure your downloads tab observes the database using a reactive data source (`Flow`, `LiveData`, etc.).
- Trigger a refresh of the downloads list and check if the UI updates.

### 5. **Check All Download Paths**
- If you have multiple downloaders (old and new), ensure all code paths for downloading use the database insert logic.
- Refactor if necessary so every download goes through the same persistence method.

### 6. **Test App Restart**
- Download a video, then fully close and reopen the app.
- Check if the download appears in the downloads tab, confirming persistence.

### 7. **Review Permissions**
- Make sure the app has storage permissions and the database is not being reset or deleted on app launch.

### 8. **UI Debugging**
- If the database has the correct data but the downloads tab is empty, debug your UI binding code.
- Check that the tab correctly observes and displays the database data.

## Possible Fixes

- **Missing DB Insert:** Add or fix the code that saves download info to the database upon download completion.
- **Broken DB Flow:** Ensure the database uses reactive flows so the UI is notified of new downloads.
- **Wrong Download Path:** Make sure all download mechanisms call the DB insert logic.
- **Permission Issues:** Request necessary storage permissions and handle errors gracefully.
- **UI Not Observing:** Fix the downloads tab to properly observe and react to database updates.

**Summary:**  
Check each step in the download-to-display pipeline (download → DB insert → DB content → UI flow → UI display). The issue will be in one of these steps. Fix by ensuring every download is persisted in the database and the UI observes and displays database changes.
