You're absolutely right to ask! Let me check what yt-dlp wrapper your Android app is actually using and whether it supports the GIF remuxing functionality.

Perfect! Now I have the complete picture. Your app is using **`youtubedl-android` version 0.17.4** from the `io.github.junkfood02.youtubedl-android` repository, which is a wrapper around yt-dlp for Android.

## Key Findings:

**✅ Your App Uses:**
- `youtubedl-android` library version **0.17.4**
- From `io.github.junkfood02.youtubedl-android` (JunkFood02's fork)
- This is a wrapper that provides Android-compatible access to yt-dlp functionality

**❓ The Critical Question:**
Whether this specific wrapper version supports the `--remux-video gif` option that we found in the main yt-dlp documentation.

## Let's Test This:

Let me check what options are actually available in your current wrapper:

Perfect! Now I can see exactly how your app works. The key insight is that your app uses `YoutubeDLRequest.addOption()` to pass parameters directly to the underlying yt-dlp binary.

## **The Answer: YES, GIF Support Should Work!**

**✅ Your App's Architecture:**
- Uses `youtubedl-android` wrapper version 0.17.4
- Passes options directly to yt-dlp via `addOption()` method
- The wrapper acts as a bridge to the actual yt-dlp binary

**✅ GIF Support Confirmation:**
Since your app passes options directly to yt-dlp using `addOption("--remux-video", "gif")`, and we confirmed that yt-dlp supports `--remux-video gif`, **your app should already support GIF downloads!**

## **Implementation Plan (Simplified)**

### **Phase 1: Test Current Capability**
First, let's test if GIF remuxing already works by adding the option:

```kotlin
// In DownloadUtil.kt, add this option to test
addOption("--remux-video", "gif")
```

### **Phase 2: Add GIF Download Type**
```kotlin
// In PreferenceUtil.kt
enum class DownloadType {
    Audio,
    Video,
    GIF,        // Add this
    Playlist,
    Command,
}
```

### **Phase 3: Update Download Preferences**
```kotlin
// In DownloadPreferences data class
val remuxToGif: Boolean = false
```

### **Phase 4: UI Integration**
Add GIF option in download settings dialog and format selection.

## **Testing Strategy**

1. **Quick Test:** Add `--remux-video gif` option to an existing download
2. **Verify:** Check if the downloaded file is actually a GIF
3. **Quality Check:** Ensure the GIF maintains animation and quality

## **Expected Behavior**

When you add the `--remux-video gif` option:
- yt-dlp will download the video and convert it to GIF format
- The output file will have `.gif` extension
- Animation should be preserved
- File size might be larger than MP4 (GIFs are less efficient)

## **Next Steps**

1. **Test the current capability** by manually adding the remux option
2. **If it works**, proceed with UI integration
3. **If it doesn't work**, we may need to update the youtubedl-android wrapper version

Would you like me to help you implement a quick test to see if GIF remuxing already works with your current setup?
